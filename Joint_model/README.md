This code is used to generate final statistics for model evaluation. It begins by generating all five formulas: Base, Social, Genetic, Joint, and Interaction. Please note disease-specific exclusions for Gender/Sex for prostate cancer (ie Gender/Sex is not used as a covariate in this model). It then extracts the AUC and CI for each model. Next, it uses DeLong's test to assess statistical significance between the models. Finally, it plots the AUC for the various diseases and models while including stars to indicate significance for Genetic vs Joint model. It will save csv files with Model AUC for plotting as well as Model AUC compairisons.
