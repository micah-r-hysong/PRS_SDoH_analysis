Given the multitude of social factors of health, we wanted to model them as one score, trained in a disease-spefic manner, to facilitate a more fair compairison with PRS. To that end, we used an elastic net model (elastic_net_models_generate_PsRS.ipynb) with a 70/30 training/testing split and five-fold cross-validation. Due to the highly corrolated nature of our SDoH variables, elastinc net is appropriate as it select relative parameters and shrink estimates from related measures. Weights were extracted from the models trained in AoU for use in your biobank. We also provided scaling files to maintain variable meaning and calibration. elastic_net_models_generate_PsRS.ipynb includes code for calculating individual-level PsRS using the AoU weights and scaling files. Additionally, we ask that you use code elastic_net_models_generate_PsRS.ipynb to train your own weights for cross-biobank comparison. MGBBioBank will only need the "PsRS_weights_file_no_income.csv"/"PsRS_scaling_file_no_income.csv" and not the "PsRS_weights_file.csv"/"PsRS_scaling_file.csv" files. Once you have the individual PsRS weights for both the AoU trained PsRS and the internally trained PsRS, go to Step 8 to joint model indidual-level PsRS and PRS using a series of logistic regression models.
