This code was used to extract measures from the American Community Survey (ACS). The following measures were extracted/calculated: fraction on assisted income / SNAP benefits, fraction of population 25 years or older with at least a high school or equivelent degree, median household income over the last 12 months, fraction with income in the past 12 months below the poverty threshold, fraction without health insurance, fraction vacant housing, following https://github.com/geomarker-io/dep_index/tree/master/2018/R. These measures were extracted from the 5-year summary data for 2013-2023. They were extracted at the 5 digit zip code level and aggregated into 3 digit zip codes as that is the level of granularity available in biobanks to protect PID. US terriroties were removed prior to deprivation index being calculated as the first PC from the other six measures. The code and data are available in this directory.
