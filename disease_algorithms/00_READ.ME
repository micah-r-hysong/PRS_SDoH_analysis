These disease phenotyping algorithms were adapted from the most recent eMERGE algorithms at the time of implementation in mid 2024. They were adapted for use in All of Us and therefore may contain some variables not seen in other cohorts such as survey answers relating to personal health history.

These algorithms can also be directly obtained in All of Us from the public workspace: https://workbench.researchallofus.org/workspaces/aou-rw-55feedb6/socialdeterminantsofhealthmeasurementmodelsv8/data

The T2D algorithm was implemented and validated as in https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-74730-9 and will be made publically available as a part of PRIMED phenotypes within the next year.

The Overivew and CKD algorithm overview pdf files offer an overview of the case control criteria for the diseases included here: Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer, CAD/CHD, Asthma, and CKD. This is not available for T2D at this time.
